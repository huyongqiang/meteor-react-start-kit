# meteor-react-start-kit

**meteor-react-start-kit** is a basic web development demo, which uses [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for the whole project architecture. This kit includes [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

You can use this repository for the start point of your project to continue development, since this kit has had a basic logic architecture of front-end and back-end.

## How to use it

If you don't have the meteor environment, get it from your terminal `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/wangdicoder/meteor-react-start-kit [your project name]`
2. `$ cd [your project name]`
3. `$ meteor npm install`
5. `$ meteor`

Then you can open the browser and see the contents at **http://localhost:3000/**
